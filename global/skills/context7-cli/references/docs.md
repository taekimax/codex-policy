# Documentation Commands

Retrieves and queries up-to-date documentation and code examples from Context7 for any programming library or framework. Two-step workflow: resolve the library name to get its ID, then query docs using that ID.

If the user already provided a library ID in `/org/project` or `/org/project/version` format, pass it directly to `ctx7 docs`.

## Step 1: Resolve a Library

Resolves a package/product name to a Context7-compatible library ID and returns matching libraries.

```bash
ctx7 library react "How to clean up useEffect with async operations"
ctx7 library nextjs "How to set up app router with middleware"
ctx7 library prisma "How to define one-to-many relations with cascade delete"
```

Always pass a `query` argument — it is required and directly affects result ranking. Use the user's intent to form the query, which helps disambiguate when multiple libraries share a similar name. Do not include any sensitive or confidential information such as API keys, passwords, credentials, personal data, or proprietary code in your query.

### Result fields

Each result includes:

- **Library ID** — Context7-compatible identifier (format: `/org/project`)
- **Name** — Library or package name
- **Description** — Short summary
- **Code Snippets** — Number of available code examples
- **Source Reputation** — Authority indicator (High, Medium, Low, or Unknown)
- **Benchmark Score** — Quality indicator (100 is the highest score)
- **Versions** — List of versions if available. Use one of those versions if the user provides a version in their query. The format is `/org/project/version`.

### Selection process

1. Analyze the query to understand what library/package the user is looking for
2. Select the most relevant match based on:
   - Name similarity to the query (exact matches prioritized)
   - Description relevance to the query's intent
   - Documentation coverage (prioritize libraries with higher Code Snippet counts)
   - Source reputation (consider libraries with High or Medium reputation more authoritative)
   - Benchmark score (higher is better, 100 is the maximum)
3. If multiple good matches exist, acknowledge this but proceed with the most relevant one
4. If no good matches exist, clearly state this and suggest query refinements
5. Ask for clarification only when the ambiguity could materially change the result and the project context cannot resolve it

IMPORTANT: Do not call `ctx7 library` more than 3 times per question. If you cannot find what you need after 3 calls, use the best result you have.

### Version-specific IDs

If the user mentions a specific version, use a version-specific library ID:

```bash
# General (latest indexed)
ctx7 docs /vercel/next.js "How to set up app router"

# Version-specific
ctx7 docs /vercel/next.js/v14.3.0-canary.87 "How to set up app router"
```

Use the exact project or requested version when it appears in `ctx7 library` output. Otherwise use the general library ID, disclose that it targets the latest indexed documentation, and check compatibility against the local dependency before applying the result. Do not describe a nearby version as an exact match.

```bash
# Output as JSON for scripting
ctx7 library react "How to use hooks for state management" --json
```

## Step 2: Query Documentation

Retrieves up-to-date documentation and code examples for the resolved library.

You must call `ctx7 library` first to obtain the exact Context7-compatible library ID required to use this command, UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format `/org/project` or `/org/project/version`.

```bash
ctx7 docs /facebook/react "How to clean up useEffect with async operations"
ctx7 docs /vercel/next.js "How to add authentication middleware to app router"
ctx7 docs /prisma/prisma "How to define one-to-many relations with cascade delete"
```

IMPORTANT: Do not call `ctx7 docs` more than 3 times per question. If you cannot find what you need after 3 calls, use the best information you have.

### Writing good queries

The query directly affects the quality of results. Be specific and include relevant details. Do not include any sensitive or confidential information such as API keys, passwords, credentials, personal data, or proprietary code in your query.

| Quality | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Good | `"How to set up authentication with JWT in Express.js"` |
| Good | `"React useEffect cleanup function with async operations"` |
| Bad | `"auth"` |
| Bad | `"hooks"` |

Form a narrow query about the public library API or behavior. Exclude private prompts and project-specific content; vague one-word queries return generic results.

The output contains two types of content: **code snippets** (titled, with language-tagged blocks) and **info snippets** (prose explanations with breadcrumb context).

```bash
# Output as structured JSON
ctx7 docs /facebook/react "How to use hooks for state management" --json
```

## Authentication Boundary

Documentation queries normally work without authentication. Do not initiate
login, create an API key, or inspect credentials from this skill. If the
service requires authentication or a higher rate limit, report that as a
separate setup decision.
